Digit recognition with TensorFlow and Keras uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. This method enhances applications like data entry, mail sorting, and check processing by improving speed and accuracy through effective feature extraction and classification of digit images.
